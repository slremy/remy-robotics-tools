This is a library that reads a portion of the screen and writes it to a buffer.


WARNING: There are no checks on the maximum screen size performed.
It is possible to ask for a screen size larger than the buffer has.
This information is processed as bytes that are made into an image.



At present, it can run on Linux and OSX, but extension to other popular operating systems should be straight forward.

It was written for use with Python, as a foreign function library.
At present the Python ImageGrab module performs this task, but has been a windows-only implementation for quite some time.
