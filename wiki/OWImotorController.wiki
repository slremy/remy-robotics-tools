#summary Brief introduction to the owimotor controller library
= Introduction =


The following instructions will presume that you are familiar with a posix like environment and command line tools that are common in several flavors of linux and environments such as cygwin.

With that said, effort has been placed to expose the provided motor controller library to languages and environments other than the c++ in which it was written.
Wrappers currently exist for Python, Octave, Matlab and Java.

Although unix style makefiles are created by default, CMake can enable it to be used in other development environments (like VS or XCode)

From a terminal window in a convenient location type the following command to download a local copy of the library:

*svn checkout http://remy-robotics-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/owimotorcontroller owimotorcontroller

This places the code into a owimotorcontroller subdirectory of the current directory.

Out of source builds of the code are recommended and the readme.txt contains the directions to compile the code.

As can be expected, tools such as TortoiseSVN, or subclipse could also be used.

==Options==
If you would like to include the matlab wrapper, at the command line, type:

*cmake -DBUILD_matlab_INTERFACES=ON ..

You can also change parameters like these in the CMakeLists.txt

At the command line (or your cmake-gui) you can also generate build solutions for Xcode, Eclipse, KDevelop3, and Visual Studio (must remember to run cmake before loading in the solution)

To make this magic happen you type something like:

*cmake -G Xcode

And include what ever other command line parameters to make the world keep spinning.

Have fun!
