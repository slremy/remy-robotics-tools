This is a library that reads a portion of the screen and writes it to a buffer.

At present, it can run on Linux and OSX, but extension to other popular operating systems should be straight forward.

It was written for use with Python, as a foreign function library.
At present the Python ImageGrab module performs this task, but has been a windows-only implementation for quite some time.

To build
  If using cmake:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
OR
  If using simple makefile

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. python screen2im.py
