This is a library that reads a portion of the screen and writes it to a buffer.

At present, it can run on Linux and OSX, but extension to other popular operating systems should be straight forward.

It was written for use with Python, as a foreign function library.
At present the Python ImageGrab module performs this task, but has been a windows-only implementation for quite some time.
